# DSP Template for the Atari Falcon

This code comes from [Mikro's cute56 repository](https://github.com/mikrosk/cute56) - which is a qt based simulator for the 56k DSP. Mikro provides code as an example of C code that can be compiled both for native 68k and for the simulator, this is that same code with the simulator parts removed. While the simulator speeds up development, I couldn't find a simple example online of working C program along with a 56k asm routine, so decided to clean out the host parts and post this here.
